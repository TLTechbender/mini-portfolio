# My first portfolio
This is my first ever usable portfolio, I'm still learning the ropes and I'm getting better.

This has to be the first project of mine where I avoided using flexbox all the way, I'm super shocked as to how responsive gridbox is, It's wonderful!!!

# Lesson learnt
* How to create dark mode for websites (This is my first one, so It may be kinda buggy and very possibly contain some unecessary code);
